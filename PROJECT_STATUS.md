## Architecture Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-31 | NestJS (not Express) for backend | Modular architecture, DI, enterprise-ready |
| 2026-05-31 | Prisma ORM | TypeScript-native, migration tooling |
| 2026-05-31 | Modular monolith (not microservices) | MVP stability over premature complexity |
| 2026-05-31 | JWT + HttpOnly cookie (not localStorage) | XSS protection |
| 2026-05-31 | PostgreSQL SELECT FOR UPDATE for reservations | Prevent race conditions / overbooking |
| 2026-05-31 | Redis for availability caching | < 200ms availability queries |
| 2026-05-31 | WebSockets for real-time room status | Avoid polling |
| 2026-05-31 | Payments abstracted behind PaymentService | Avoid vendor lock-in, support Stripe + Tranzila |
| 2026-05-31 | Availability Engine before Reservations (Phase 4 before 5) | Avoid AvailabilityService being duplicated in reservation logic |
| 2026-06-01 | CSRF double-submit cookie on all cookie-mutating auth endpoints | Protects login/refresh/logout from CSRF; GET /csrf issues non-HttpOnly token |
| 2026-06-01 | Manual Prisma migration file (not `migrate dev`) | No DB available at code-time; migration applied on `prisma migrate deploy` |
| 2026-06-01 | Integration tests drop immutability RULEs in afterAll | RULEs block FK cascade SET NULL needed for test cleanup; re-created by migration on next reset |
| 2026-05-31 | Security foundations in Phase 0–1 (not Phase 11) | Mandatory per ARCH §7.1 — not optional afterthoughts |
| 2026-05-31 | Guest Portal uses tokenized links (no guest login) | Reduces friction, ARCH §10 requirement |
| 2026-05-31 | DB-level audit_log immutability (REVOKE + RULE) | Application-layer immutability bypassable |
| 2026-06-14 | pg_trgm for guest name search + raw $queryRaw | Prisma client doesn't support `%` trigram operator; raw query used only in search endpoint |
| 2026-06-14 | Duplicate detection returns 409 (not blocking in UI) | Legal/business requirement: warn staff but don't prevent creation of guests with shared info |
| 2026-06-22 | Reservation model added in Phase 4 (not Phase 5) | AvailabilityService must query reservations; adding model early avoids re-migration |
| 2026-06-22 | cache-manager v7 `clear()` instead of `reset()` | v7 renamed the method; full-cache clear acceptable given 30s TTL and future Redis key-pattern support |
| 2026-06-22 | RoomStatusGateway in RoomsModule (not standalone) | Gateway emits on room status changes — collocating with RoomsService avoids circular deps |

---

## Open Questions

| # | Question | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Which payment provider: Stripe or Tranzila (or both)? | Open |
| 2 | Website booking engine: internal build or external integration? | Open |
| 3 | Email provider: SendGrid or AWS SES? | Open |
| 4 | Cloud provider: AWS or GCP? | Open |
| 5 | Hebrew-only or multilingual UI? | Assumed Hebrew-only for MVP |

---

## Known Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reservation race conditions | Critical | SELECT FOR UPDATE + optimistic locking | Phase 4, 5 |
| Payment failure states | Critical | Idempotent operations + retry-safe architecture | Phase 7 |
| Permission leakage | Critical | Centralized auth middleware + security audit | Phase 1, 11 |
| Scope creep | High | Phase gate: exit criteria must pass before next phase | All |
| Guest portal token theft | High | Short TTL, HTTPS only, one-time tokens for payment | Phase 8 |

---

## ARCH to Phase Mapping

| ARCHITECTURE.md Phase | Our Phase Docs |
|---|---|
| Phase 1: Platform Foundation | Phase 0 + Phase 1 |
| Phase 2: Core Hotel Operations | Phases 2–6 |
| Phase 3: Financial Operations | Phase 7 |
| Phase 4: Guest Portal | Phase 8 |
| Phase 5: Reporting & Dashboards | Phase 10 |
| Phase 6: Operational Stabilization | Phases 11–12 |
